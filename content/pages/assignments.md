Graded Assignments
------------------

Your solutions to these graded questions must be submitted by the date specified below. Assignments 1-6 are to be completed individually. Assignments 7-9 involve case analysis and are to be done in half-groups.

Optional Questions
------------------

The optional questions are end-of-chapter problems that were chosen to provide particular reinforcement of the class topic. They are all from the course textbook, Pratt J., _Financial Accounting in an Economic Context_, 5th ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

These optional problems generally deal with record keeping and reporting and computations. They are designed to reinforce concepts learned through reading assignments, homework problems, case discussions, and T.A. sessions.
