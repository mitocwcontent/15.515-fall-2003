Objectives
----------

This section of the session road map below specifies the learning objectives you should achieve through (a) the assigned readings and homework, (b) the class discussion or lecture, or (c) the weekly T.A. session (if needed). Periodically, it also summarizes key concepts. You and your group can gauge your progress by assessing the extent to which you have met these objectives and understand the concepts.<

Class Preparation Questions
---------------------------

As these problems are related to the class discussion and often will be used as the basis of class discussion, they should receive your utmost attention. You may find it valuable to discuss these with your group members before class. Some questions refer to the Intel 2002 Annual Report, which is available for download from the Intel Web site.

How would they do it? What risks are involved?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}3\.

On 1/1/90, CC sells a stereo for $1,000 cash. Cost of inventory is $900. Customer also pays $100 cash for 2-year warranty coverage, which CC expects to require $20 in parts and labor over that period (through 12/31/91).  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}b. 12/90, the customer brings the stereo in for inspection. Actual cost to CC is $8.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}c. 12/91, the customer brings the stereo in again; actual cost to CC is $15.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}2\. Compare yearly and total Net Income (i.e., for 1990 + 1991) of the scenario posed above under the three accounting treatments.  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}3\.

How do these relate (if at all) to the physical flow of products sold?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}2\. When costs are increasing over time, which assumption (LIFO or FIFO) results in higher reported Net Income? In a higher reported value for Inventory on the Balance Sheet?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}3\. What does "LIFO Reserve" represent? What causes it to increase or decrease?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}4\. Does Intel use LIFO or FIFO? Where would you find this information?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}5\. Calculate Intel's 2002 Inventory Turnover ratio. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

Are there cash flow effects of the "mark-to-market" rule?  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}3\.
