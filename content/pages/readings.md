The reading assignments listed below are what you should read _before_ coming to class. The class lectures assume this reading has been done, and while you may not completely understand the material you will have a familiarity with the concepts and transactions we will be covering each day. Additional short readings (e.g., recent business press articles) will be distributed in class.

Readings that refer to "Pratt" can be found in the course textbook, J. Pratt, _Financial Accounting in an Economic Context_, 5th ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Other readings are from the Intel 2002 Annual Report, which is available for download from the [Web site](https://www.intel.cn/content/dam/doc/report/history-2002-annual-report.pdf). "CP" stands for the Case Pack of readings that students purchase.
